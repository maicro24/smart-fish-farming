# Smart Fish Farming – JunctionX Algiers Hackathon 🇩🇿

🔴 **We built a smarter way to farm fish at JunctionX Algiers Hackathon (2025).**

## 🌍 The Challenge
Algeria’s fish farming sector faces:
- High mortality rates  
- Unstable pond conditions  
- Heavy reliance on imported red tilapia  

But we saw an opportunity within this challenge.  

## 💡 Our Solution
With **Team Control**, we developed a smart, integrated digital platform that helps farmers manage their ponds more **efficiently, responsively, and sustainably**.

## 🚀 Features (built in just 48h)
- 📊 **Real-time water quality monitoring**  
- ⚠️ **Instant alerts** for anomalies (e.g. high ammonia, low oxygen)  
- 📈 **Historical trend visualization** of water parameters  
- 🤖 **AI-powered detection** of underwater waste  
- 🌀 **3D simulation** of pond health conditions**  
- 🔬 **Predictive analysis** of bacterial threats  
- 💬 **AI chatbot assistant** for farmers & technicians  
- 👥 **Role-based user management** and centralized notifications  
- 📱 **Offline SMS alerts** for critical issues  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data Science & AI** (predictive models, anomaly detection, OpenCV)  
- **Web Development** (real-time dashboards, clean UX)  
- **IoT & Sensors** (water quality monitoring)  
- **Cloud & APIs** (notifications, SMS integration)  

## 🎯 Impact
This project shows how **data + AI + collaboration** can:
- Reduce fish mortality  
- Optimize farm operations  
- Strengthen food security  
- Empower Algerian farmers with digital tools  

## 👨‍💻 Team Control
